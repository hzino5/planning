# Project Proposal
The project Tourist Information Website aims to develop a user friendly website that serves as a comprehensive resource for tourists seeking information about local attractions, accommodations, dining, and activities. This initiative addresses the common challenge of fragmented information sources by providing a centralised platform that enhances the travel experience and supports local businesses.
## Business Case

### Problem statement
It aims to tackle the challenge of providing tourists with easy access to reliable and comprehensive information about local attractions, accommodations, dining, and activities. Many travelers struggle to find centralized resources, often resulting in missed opportunities and a frustrating experience. This website will serve as a one-stop hub for essential travel information, enhancing the overall tourist experience while promoting local businesses.

### Business benefits
The Website is designed to significantly enhance the travel experience for visitors by providing a comprehensive and user-friendly platform. Tourists will benefit from having a single source for essential information about local attractions, accommodations, dining, and activities, making trip planning much simpler and more enjoyable. This centralized resource not only helps travelers navigate their options easily but also supports local businesses by promoting their services and boosting visibility in a crowded market. Engaging features like user reviews, event calendars, and customizable itineraries will foster a sense of community among visitors, allowing them to share their experiences and recommendations. 

### Options Considered
There are plenty of options out there that meet the same needs as a Tourist Information Website. For instance, popular travel apps like TripAdvisor and Yelp help users find local attractions, restaurants, and activities, complete with reviews from other travelers. Many cities also have their own tourism websites that offer useful information about local sights and events. Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook are great for discovering travel tips through posts from influencers and everyday travelers.

### Expected Risks
The project faces several key risks that could impact its success. One is keeping content accurate and up to date is crucial as outdated information could lead to negative experiences for users. Secondly, User engagement is another risk because if the site doesnâ€™t generate enough interaction, it could struggle to be effective.
